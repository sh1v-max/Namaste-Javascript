# Execution Context.

#### Everything in JS happens inside the execution context.

Assume the execution context to be a big box where everything takes place. It has 2 components in it:

Memory :The place where all the variables and functions are stored as (key: value) pairs. Memory component is also known as the variable environment.

Code : The place where code is executed one line at a time. Code component is also known as theThread of Execution

### JS is a synchronous single-threaded language.
